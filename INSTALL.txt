Untar the .tgz or tar.gz of the pussh/ directory
wherever you prefer to run it from like so: 

tar -zxpf pussh_2.2.tar.gz 

and then simply run the script from there eg.

[0]$ /homedir> pussh/pussh --help

or

[0]$ /whatever/path> ~/pussh/pussh --help

Good luck, and thanks for your support.

PS. There is one package dependency which not all systems have, and that is netcat aka "nc".
