Pussh Version 2.2 contains even less changes than the last, but it's 
just a warm-up for something big that cometh ... and that right soon.

Pussh Version 2.1 is a small change - cleaning up superfluous protocol
options in brussh.py, when it was noticed these stop pussh working from
Solaris.

PuSSH Version 2 has 2 dramatic new features:
1. added overall port specification functionality. Port 22 is still
   the default, but really, nobody uses port 22 anymore these days for 
   SSH on machines exposed to the world; the requirement is elementary.
2. changed a fundamental thing in brussh.py from version 1 - targets 
   are no longer "acquired" using ping; targets are now confirmed as
   ready to receive ssh commands using netcat, with netcat testing for
   SSH on the port specified (see point 1); using netcat instead of
   ping in order to acquire target hosts changes the behavior somewhat,
   but not too badly; another obvious advantage is that target machines
   don't need to be pingable, and as PuSSH implements it, netcat can 
   tell if a target is up even if it won't respond to ssh, which could
   be useful in some circumstances. 
3. finally, some minor improvements here and there, to the help text and
   code.
